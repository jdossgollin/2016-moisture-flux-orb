    \begin{itemize}
        \item Posterior checking (not shown) reveals that modeling all interactions as normal (\cref{eq:yX,eq:XZ}) is an overly strong assumption; specific distributions for specific interactions may improve prediction
        \item Explore additional parameters and interactions
        \item Consideration of GMX SST anomalies as a local feature addresses thermodynamic impact on moisture availability, but is not independent of large-scale circulations; likely not a one-directional causality
        \item Model dependence of global features explicity using copulas \cite[\ie][]{Genest2007}
    \end{itemize}
