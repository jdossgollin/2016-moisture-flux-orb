\begin{block}{Summary of Findings}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A finite set of specific synoptic circulation patterns accounts for most DJF moisture transport into the Ohio River Basin
        \item Persistent steering mechanisms such as the PNA and NAO alter the dominant directions of cyclone propagation over the region, leading to changes in moisture transport
        \item The PNA and NAO provide both positive and negative feedbacks on moisture transport to the Ohio River Basin. Modeling these intermediate feedbacks explicity \textbf{improves model propagation of opposing feedbacks and variance} as compared to modeling moisture transport directly on the global-scale indices.
    \end{enumerate}
