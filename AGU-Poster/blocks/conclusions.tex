\begin{block}{Summary of Findings}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A finite set of specific synoptic circulation patterns accounts for most DJF moisture transport into the Ohio River Basin
        \item Results suggest that the W. Atlantic high, particularly when it is persistent (blocking), may be more relevant to DJF Ohio River Basin moisture transport than the transient low or source region temperature
        \item The PNA and NAO each provide positive and negative feedbacks on moisture transport to the Ohio River Basin. Modeling these intermediate feedbacks explicity \textbf{improves model propagation of opposing feedbacks and variance} as compared to modeling moisture transport directly on the global-scale indices.
    \end{enumerate}
