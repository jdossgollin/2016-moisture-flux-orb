\begin{block}{Discussion \& Conclusions}
    Our multi-level model is linear, with single-directional causality; reality is of course more complicated.
    Interactions matter and many of the features we select are intermediate (blocking high).
    However, by using a two-level model, we show that \texttt{STUFF}
    Our results support the hypotheses that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A finite set of specific synoptic circulation patterns accounts for most DJF moisture transport into the Ohio River Basin.
        \item Persistent steering mechanisms \texttt{word this}
        \item Modeling our way is better!
    \end{enumerate}
