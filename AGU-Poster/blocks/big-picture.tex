\begin{block}{Conceptual Framework}
    Making credible forecasts of future flood probabilities from sub-seasonal to decadal timescales \cite{Merz2014} requires understanding the cross-timescale dynamics that regulate the joint distribution of the frequency, intensity, and persistence of rainfall.
    Case study \cite[\ie][]{Grams2014} and theory support the view that persistent intense rainfall does not occur randomly, but rather that the large-scale transport \& convergence of moisture is governed by specific circulations mechanisms which are in turn modulated by global-scale circulations and persistent, low-frequency boundary conditions.

    For example, the April 2011 flooding in the Ohio-Mississippi river system led to sever damage.
    As \cref{fig:apr2011} shows, the monthly rainfall was driven by a strong and persistent jet which steered multiple cyclones along highly similar trajectories.
