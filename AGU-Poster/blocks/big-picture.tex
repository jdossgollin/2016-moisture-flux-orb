\begin{block}{Conceptual Framework}
    Managing and adapting flood risk requires estimates of the joint distribution of flood frequency and intensity into the future.
    While traditional approaches have taken either purely statistical or model chaining (climate model to hydrological model) paths, we view floods as being caused by a \emph{hierarchy of causal mechanisms} \cite[see][]{Merz2014}.
    Specifically, we hypothesize that there is a unique set of atmospheric circulation mechanisms that can lead to sufficient large-scale transport and convergence of moisture for extreme regional flooding.
