    Floods associated with persistent extreme regional rainfall may be determined by cross-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics that link persistent global surface conditions as well as regional interactions with these evolving patterns.
    For example, the April 2011 flooding in the Ohio-Mississippi river system (\cref{fig:apr2011,fig:nasa-2010-11}) was driven by steering of multiple storms into the region along highly similar trajectories.
