\begin{block}{Research Questions}
    Moisture flux can be more predictable than extreme rainfall \cite{Lavers2016}.
    Here, we address the following questions, using the Ohio River Basin (\cref{fig:study-area}) as a case study and focusing on the DJF season because other mechanisms of moisture transport are suppressed:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What synoptic circulations lead to intense tropical moisture export into the Ohio River Basin?
        \item What planetary-scale circulations modulate these synoptic circulations?
        \item What are the conditional probabilities of moisture given synoptic and planetary circulations?
    \end{enumerate}
