\begin{block}{Synoptic Patterns}
    Inspection of cyclone track locations and the associated moisture flux into the region (not shown) shows that moisture flux into the region is maximized in the presence of a cyclone to the north-west of the region.
    \Cref{fig:track-given-flux} shows this in terms of cyclone tracks: tracks associated with extremely high flux (R) follow highly similar trajectories from the south-west to north-east (SW$\rightarrow$NE).
    This pathway is much less frequently observed among randomly sampled tracks (L).
