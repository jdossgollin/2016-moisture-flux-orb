\begin{block}{Global-Scale Modulation}
    A primary mechanism by which global-scale circulations such as the PNA modulate moisture flux into the mid-latitudes is by shifting the storm tracks.
    \Cref{fig:track-given-pna} shows the cyclone tracks over the study area for the negative and positive PNA terciles.
    Relative to the negative phase, the positive PNA shifts the SW$\rightarrow$NE tracks to the east and favors a NW$\rightarrow$SE trajectory over the Ohio River Basin.
